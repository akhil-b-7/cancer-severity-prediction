# cancer-severity-prediction

In this data-driven healthcare project, I aim to analyze a comprehensive dataset of cancer
patients to uncover crucial insights into the factors influencing cancer severity. Through
meticulous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling techniques, I seek
to identify the key predictors that contribute to classifying cancer levels as Low, Medium, or
High. By leveraging advanced tools such as data visualization, correlation analysis, and Random
Forest modeling, I intend to provide healthcare professionals with valuable information for
enhancing patient care and treatment strategies. This project not only showcases the power of
data science in addressing critical healthcare questions but also underscores the potential
impact of data-driven decision-making in improving the outcomes and well-being of cancer
patients.
